# clustered_dendrogram

market segmentation using k-means to identify target variables based on user demographics <br>
purchase prediction using logistic regression to predict binary variable of Purchased / Not Purchased as determined by target feature variants
<br><br>
<b>primary models:</b><br>
<ul>
<li><b>K-means</b> used to identify and label dominant target clusters based on cluster and sub-cluster feature variants<br> </li>
<li><b>Binary logistic regression</b> used to classify features based on binary target variable of Purchased/Not Purchased <br> </li>
<li><b>classification report, confusion matrix</b> used to determine accuracy of model at predicting future Purchased/Not Purchased <br> </li>
</ul>
